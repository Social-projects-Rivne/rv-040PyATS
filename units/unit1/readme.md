Write one test for each function located in calculation.py module. The tests have to be a part of one class. Also, a user needs to
pass num1 and num2 while running the tests. By default, num1	=	3 , num2	=	0 . If there are math errors (like ZeroDivisionError ),
make a test as passx . If the calculated value is less than 0 , please skip the test. All other cases have to be considered as passed.

#run
-run in terminal: 'python <path>/tests_calculation.py -num1 <number1> -num2 <number2>' 
or 
run: 'python <path>/tests_calculation.py'
