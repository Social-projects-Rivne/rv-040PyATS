There are two numbers. Each of them can be negative, floating etc. You need to create a job which will accept two numbers as the
arguments. This job has to run in parallel 4 different tests: multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. Each of these tests will
perform an appropriate math operation on given numbers. A test has to fail if the calculation result is less then 0, otherwise, the test is
passed.

#run
-run in terminal: 'easypy <path>/tests_all.py -num1 <number1> -num2 <number2>'
